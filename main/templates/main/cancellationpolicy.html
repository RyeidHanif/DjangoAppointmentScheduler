                <p>
                    This cancellation policy exists to ensure reliability and respect for everyone’s time — both service providers and customers.
                    Booking an appointment is a commitment, and last-minute cancellations or no-shows severely disrupt the system.

                    To prevent abuse, the following rules apply strictly to all customers:

                <p>
                    Service providers are held to an equal standard of responsibility:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        If a provider cancels or no-shows <strong>more than 3 times</strong> within any rolling <strong>30-day period</strong>,
                        their account will be <span class="text-danger fw-bold">automatically banned</span> from the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        Customers rely on provider availability — inconsistency is not tolerated.

                <p>
                    If you missed an appointment due to a legitimate emergency, you may contact support within 24 hours with documented proof.
                    Exceptions are rare and granted only in verifiable circumstances.

                <p>
                    Repeated cancellations waste time, harm trust, and break the scheduling system for everyone. This policy is strictly enforced with no leniency.
                    By using our platform, you agree to these terms.
